= MySQL 8.0.4+ authentication with Flyway / MariaDB Driver

See this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51670095[Stack Overflow question]

Flyway is using the MariaDB JDBC driver, which not appear to support the new default
authentication plugin in MySQL 8.0.4, `caching_sha2_password`.

One way around this is to revert to the previous default authentication plugin:

[indent=0]
----
  docker-mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0.11
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
----

The other option would be to download the official http://central.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.11/mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar[MySQL JDBC driver jar] and place in the `./drivers` directory.

Then mount that directory in the Flyway container:

[indent=0]
----
  flyway:
    image: boxfuse/flyway
    command: ...
    volumes:
     - "./sql:/flyway/sql"
     - "./drivers:/flyway/drivers"
----
